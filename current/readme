ipblocker
=========

ipblocker for FreeBSD

Supervises the log which checks through regular expressions.
Blocks the IP addresses connected with found events through the add 
to table in rules ipfw.
Supervises time of block and automatical unblock.

ipblocker based on  log of syslogd format, but filter can supervises any 
log's format through special regular expressions for this format.

ipblocker have client's and server's modules. The client filters log from 
standart input and sends events to server. Server analyze time and 
block\unblock IP.

Client support to use with syslog.conf and plain log files as input.
Server must work as daemon to client used syslogd.conf method.

You have to be shure that events in log-file don't repeat when you use 
logfile as input several times. For this purpose it is necessary to make 
log to temporary file, filter this file with filter-ipblck and after that make 
add this temporary file to real logfile for save or analyze anything.

May be better way server start and stop in packet file while client use logfile 
as input.

Use Perl CPAN Date::Manip module

Examples:

1. use syslogd
Make copy ipblocker to /usr/local/etc/rc.d/

add to rc.conf:
ipblockerd_enable="YES"

add rule to ipfw rules, where N - number of table from ipblocker.conf :
ipfw add deny from table(N) to me
ipfw add deny from me to table(N)

add to syslogd.conf next line:
 
security.*                                      |exec /usr/local/etc/ipblocker/filter-ipblck security
!ipblockerd
*.*                                             /var/log/ipblocker.log
*.*                                             |exec /usr/local/etc/ipblocker/filter-ipblck ipblocker

2. use logfile as input
Make copy ipblocker to /usr/local/etc/rc.d/

add to rc.conf:
ipblockerd_enable="YES"

make shure that in vsftpd.conf :
xferlog_file=/var/log/vsftp-tmp.log

create packet file like this and run from cron:
#!/bin/sh
IPBLCK=/usr/local/etc/ipblocker
mv /var/log/vsftp-tmp.log /tmp/current
cat /tmp/current | %IPBLCK%/filter-ipblck vsftp
cat /tmp/current >> /var/log/vsftp.log && rm /tmp/current

3. use logfile as input ( alternative )
!!! and ipblocker/filter in packet must use other port.
!!! you can start/stop ipblocker from cron for not use daemon
!!! in this way ipblocker's daemon only more precisely check 
!!! timeout for unblock IP ( if it is necessary )

Make copy ipblocker to /usr/local/etc/rc.d/

add to rc.conf:
ipblockerd_enable="YES"

create packet file like this:
#!/bin/sh
IPBLCK=/usr/local/etc/ipblocker
%IPBLCK%/ipblockerd start %IPBLCK%/ipblocker-other.conf
cat /var/log/vsftp.log | %IPBLCK%/filter-ipblck vsftp
%IPBLCK%/ipblockerd stop %IPBLCK%/ipblocker-other.conf
